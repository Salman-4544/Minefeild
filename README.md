# Minefeild
A simple clicker game that has similar mechanic like the [Minesweeper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minesweeper_(video_game)) game the difference is : my game is very simple(only 6x6 square), doesn't have flag or marker, and have very random mines that lies somewhere in the feild

## Rule
this game has a very simple rule, that is you must not step on four mines on the field. this game has very random mines that lies somewhere beneath the field, so you don't need any skill but only luck so be carefull
